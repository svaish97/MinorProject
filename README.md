# Minor Project
This application was build as a college project.

# Overview

In this application the user has to select a leaf image and send to the server. The server receives in return classifies the images and return us the category of the leaves.

## How it works

This projects first trains data using machine learning algorithms and then dumps(saves them). After that we have created a flask server and whenever user sends image to this server we load our trained model and pass the images over that to get our result.
